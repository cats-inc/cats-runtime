# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

> This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for documenting significant technical decisions.

## Purpose

ADRs capture the context, decision, and consequences of architectural choices. They help:

- Future developers understand *why* decisions were made
- Prevent re-discussing settled decisions
- Create institutional memory across sessions and team members

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:

- Choosing a framework, library, or technology
- Making architectural decisions (patterns, structure)
- Deciding between multiple valid alternatives
- Making decisions that are difficult to reverse

## Naming Convention

```
ADR-NNN-short-title.md

Examples:
ADR-001-use-postgresql-database.md
ADR-002-adopt-hexagonal-architecture.md
ADR-003-jwt-authentication.md
```

## Template

Use [000-template.md](./000-template.md) as the starting point for new ADRs.

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [000-template](./000-template.md) | Template | - | - |
<!-- Add new ADRs above this line -->

## For AI Agents

1. **Before making a decision**: Check this directory for existing relevant records
2. **After making a decision**: Create a new ADR using the template
3. **Update the index**: Add the new ADR to the table above
